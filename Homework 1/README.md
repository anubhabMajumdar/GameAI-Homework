# CSC 584 : Homework 1

The Homework 1 folder contains 4 sub-folders:

1. Kinematic motion - This contains code for basic-motion. Please run the KinematicMotion.java file to see output.

2. Arriving Steering Behaviour - This contains code for arrive-steering. Please run DriverProgram.java to see output. Click on the canvas to make the character "arrive" at that location. 2 circular boundaries denote the ROD and ROS. 

3. Wander Steering Behaviour - This contains code for wander-steering. Please run DriverProgram.java to see output.

4. Flocking - This contains code for flocking-behavior. Please run DriverProgram.java to see output. Initially all characters move randomly. Click anywhere on the canvas to activate flocking behaviour. Click again to deactivate flocking. Please note : processing sometimes consider one click as multiple. I have set the program to output the flockingStatus on the console. "true" denotes flocking is activated, "false" denotes the opposite.
