# CSC 584 : Homework 2

Use eclipse or Intellij to run the programs. Processing library and ControlP5 library has been added to the folders.

1. First Steps

The smaller hand-crafted graph is stored in world_graph2.txt.
The larger graph is stored in cit-HepPh.txt. This graph is freely available to use from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepPh.html. All the references has been cited in the writeup. It is not refered in the file itself as the file needs to be structured in a particular way to be parsed correctly by the program.

2. PathFinding algorithms

To test the pathfinding algorithms, please run DriverClass.java. It provides a simple GUI to test and compare both Dijkstra's and A* algorithm on both the graphs and two different heuristic for A* algorithm.
I have used the freely available processing library called "controlP5", developed by Andreas Schlegel, 2015, for the GUI - http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/#about. The library and its documentation is referenced to the best of my knowledge in the source code. Here are the references- http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/#about, http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/#examples and http://www.kasperkamperman.com/blog/processing-code/controlp5-library-example1/. 

3. Pathfinding and pathfollowing in indoor environment

To test the indoor environment pathfollowing, please run IndoorPathfinding.java. Click anywhere in the white pixel region to have the character travel there.

Please check the Indoor pathfollowing in action here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nXZMcw15nM&feature=youtu.be
